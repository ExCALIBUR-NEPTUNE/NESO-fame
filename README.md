# NESO-fame

The Field-Aligned Mesh Extrusion (fame) tool generates meshes for
Tokamaks with elements aligned with magnetic field lines. Currently
this work is highly experimental.

**Note:** Unlike other repositories in the NEPTUNE project, this one
is licensed under GPLv3, as it depends on
[hypnotoad](https://github.com/boutproject/hypnotoad), which is
similarly licensed.

**Note:** This code uses Nektar++ Python bindings which have not been
merged into the master branch. They are accessible from
https://gitlab.nektar.info/cmacmackin/nektar on branch
`cmacmackin/generate-nonconformal-meshes`.
