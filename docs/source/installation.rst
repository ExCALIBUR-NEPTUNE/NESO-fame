Installation
============

The recommended way to install NESO-fame (for the time being) is using
`spack <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. See the `main NESO
README
<https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO#building-with-spack>`_ for
further instructions. You must install from the ``cmacmackin/meshing``
branch of the NESO repository.

.. note::
   This code uses Nektar++ Python bindings which have not been
   merged into the master branch. They are accessible from
   https://gitlab.nektar.info/cmacmackin/nektar on branch
   ``cmacmackin/generate-nonconformal-meshes``.
